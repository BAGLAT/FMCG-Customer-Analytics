# FMCG-Customer-Analytics
Building a STP(Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning) model on B2C clients.

Techniques Involved:
1. K-means Clustering
2. PCA
3. Elasticity Modeling

Customer Analytics: The first part of the project focuses on how to perform customer segmentation,
using a hands-on approach. It involves the application of hierarchical and flat clustering techniques for
dividing customers into groups. It also features applying the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to
reduce the dimensionality of the problem, as well as combining PCA and K-means for an even more
professional customer segmentation.

Purchase Analytics: The second part of the project explores both the descriptive and predictive
analysis of the purchase behaviour of customers, including models for purchase incidence, brand
choice, and purchase quantity
